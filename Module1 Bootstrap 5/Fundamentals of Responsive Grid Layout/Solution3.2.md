# Solution 3.2: Responsive Grid with .container, .row, and .col-*

Solution is the same as [Solution 3.1](https://github.com/harshaa-praharshidha01/Java_Upskilling_Praharshidha/blob/main/Module1%20Bootstrap%205/Fundamentals%20of%20Responsive%20Grid%20Layout/Solution3.1.html).

This solution uses Bootstrap's responsive grid system with `.container`, `.row`, and `.col-*` classes.
